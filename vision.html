            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">How Kinship Might Unfold</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p class="intro-text">Kinship exists, at this stage, as a proposal and an invitation. I am one person with a vision, seeking others to explore together what it might mean to live according to the Seven Laws. What follows represents some initial thinking—not a blueprint, but conversation starters. All of this is provisional and open to transformation.</p>
            
            <p>A principle from Fukuoka's natural farming informs our approach: asking what is NOT necessary rather than what more we can add. This minimalism—working with natural processes—shapes how we explore, but the Seven Laws and three freedoms are our foundation.</p>
            
            <h2>The Journey Ahead</h2>
            
            <p>I imagine potentially beginning to journey together from mid-2026—meeting, traveling, working together, visiting places, learning each other's rhythms. Perhaps by autumn 2027 we find ourselves somewhere we want to stay, in whatever arrangement that might be—a temporary base, a longer-term situation, perhaps even land we steward together. Or perhaps we remain more itinerant. The path reveals itself through walking it together.</p>
            
            <h2>Ways of Relating</h2>
            
            <p>However Kinship unfolds, I imagine different ways people might relate to it:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Core participants</strong> are those whose primary commitment is to this exploration—traveling together, living together, building together, whatever form that takes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Supporters</strong> are those who believe in this inquiry and contribute in various ways—financially, through skills, through hospitality, through connection—whether closely involved or from afar.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Journeyers</strong> might join for periods of learning and exchange, where everyone is simultaneously teacher and student.</p>
            
            <p>But even these distinctions may be unnecessary. We'll discover what makes sense.</p>
            
            <h2>If Land Becomes Part of Our Path</h2>
            
            <p>Should legal ownership become necessary—and we ask first whether it is—we'd approach it as a formality, recognizing that truly owning land is not possible. The land would not belong to Kinship but would be kin. As a partner, it would have as much right as any one of us. Any legal structure would acknowledge this relationship while providing what formality requires, and nothing more.</p>
            
            <p>People would contribute what they can. Some may have more resources, others less. What matters is shared commitment to principles. We'd work out specifics together, guided by non-speculation, transparency, and the understanding that this isn't investment but stewardship.</p>
            
            <h2>If We Settle (In Whatever Form)</h2>
            
            <p>We begin with what is necessary and add only as necessary. What shelter do we actually need? What infrastructure? What cultivation? The question is always: what can we do without?</p>
            
            <p>We might start with temporary structures, rented spaces, borrowed land, or something else entirely. We'd develop what we need gradually, always through the lens of subtraction before addition.</p>
            
            <p>We'd explore diverse ways of meeting needs—some cultivation, some foraging, some hunting, some craft—without committing to any system as complete. We'd experiment with what works in our specific context, using the Seven Laws as our lens.</p>
            
            <h2>Governance</h2>
            
            <p>We'd formalize only what we must. Dissensus principles might guide us: individual sovereignty within shared ecological commitments. Stewardship emerging from demonstrated care rather than imposed hierarchy. But we resist the urge to create elaborate structures in advance. Forms evolve through living them, and the best governance may be the least governance necessary.</p>
            
            <h2>Cultural Propagation</h2>
            
            <p>Knowledge exchanges and gatherings would create connections between people and ways of knowing. Not education provision, not programming, not scheduled workshops—just spaces where people meet and learn from each other. We might document what we learn, but only if doing so serves the work rather than becoming the work.</p>
            
            <h2>What Stays Fixed</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The Seven Laws of Ecology as foundation</li>
                <li>The three freedoms (to move, disobey, create new social worlds)</li>
                <li>Understanding that we cannot truly own land or anything—we can only be kin to it</li>
                <li>Anti-accumulation in all its forms</li>
                <li>Small scale (whatever number emerges naturally)</li>
                <li>Dissensus rather than consensus</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Everything else—location, timeline, structures, practices, whether we settle or remain itinerant, what form any settlement takes—remains open.</p>
            
            <h2>Risk and Reality</h2>
            
            <p>This requires accepting genuine uncertainty. Financial contributions might not be recoverable. The experiment might fail. This life might not be for you. We're exploring together, not executing a plan.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p class="intro-text">My name is Francesco. I hold dual Italian-Australian citizenship and speak Italian, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. I've lived in Australia, Italy, India, Thailand, Sweden, the UK, and the US, and traveled extensively. This geographical mobility has shaped my understanding that ways of living are not universal truths but cultural choices—and that other choices are possible.</p>
            
            <p>I completed a PhD in Human Geography, researching how people related to water as a means to give shape to lives that they had reason to value. My academic work explored how humans create meaning through their interactions with landscape and community. The research gave me theoretical frameworks for understanding human-place relationships, but theory alone felt insufficient. I wanted to understand how to live differently, not just write about it.</p>
            
            <h2>Some Formative Experiences</h2>
            
            <p>I spent time in Buddhist monasteries, learning practices of mindfulness, simplicity, and intentional community. These experiences taught me about the power of restraint, the importance of practice over theory, and what it means to live with less. The monastic life showed me that many things contemporary culture considers necessary are actually optional—and that their absence can create rather than diminish freedom.</p>
            
            <p>I also spent a considerable part of 2025 volunteering on a farm following Masanobu Fukuoka's principles of natural farming—what he called "do-nothing agriculture" that works with natural processes rather than against them. Fukuoka's core question shapes my thinking: "What is it NOT necessary to do?" This principle of minimalism—asking what we can subtract rather than what we can add—informs how I approach Kinship, though it's not the central pillar. The Seven Laws and three freedoms are the foundation; this minimalist practice is simply one way of honoring them.</p>
            
            <p>Through natural farming, I've learned that the most profound interventions are often the subtlest, that limits create rather than constrain possibility, and that our role is not to control but to partner with natural processes. I've watched how accepting what a landscape offers—rather than forcing it to produce what we want—actually yields abundance. The land teaches, if we learn to listen.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Kinship?</h2>
            
            <p>I've watched the systems supporting life fray under the weight of a civilization fundamentally at odds with how life functions. Species disappear at alarming rates. Climate shifts into states that may or may not support many life forms, including ours.</p>
            
            <p>Many of us find ourselves in purposeless work that does little more than ensure enough money to buy consumer goods that don't satisfy us. Technologies that were supposed to enhance human experience increasingly turn us into their tools.</p>
            
            <p>I believe there are different ways to live—ways that align with ecological principles rather than violate them, that create genuine freedom rather than offering its simulation. But I don't have answers or a blueprint. What I have is a set of principles (the Seven Laws, the three freedoms) and a willingness to explore what they might mean in practice.</p>
            
            <p>Kinship is about rediscovering relationship—with each other, yes, but equally with land, water, animals, plants, the whole community of life. It's about practicing kinship in the way many indigenous peoples have always understood it: recognizing ourselves as related to and responsible for the more-than-human world, not separate from or above it.</p>
            
            <h2>What I'm Seeking</h2>
            
            <p>I'm seeking people willing to walk into uncertainty together, to practice this exploration of kinship, to question assumptions about what's necessary for a good life, to learn from natural processes. People who hear "primitive" as a compliment rather than an insult—who see living close to the land, using simple tools, meeting needs directly as aspiration rather than deprivation.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't about following me or my vision. I'm someone who's done thinking and reading, who's had some relevant experiences, and who's willing to take the risk of actually trying to live differently. What I'm proposing is that we explore together what it might mean to live as kin to all life, guided by shared principles but discovering the forms through practice.</p>
            
            <h2>Current Work</h2>
            
            <p>I recently finished translating William Ophuls's <em>Immoderate Greatness: Why Civilizations Fail</em> into Italian. The book examines why complex civilizations inevitably overextend and collapse. Understanding this trajectory helps us recognize that industrial civilization's current crises aren't anomalies to be fixed but predictable outcomes of exceeding ecological limits.</p>
            
            <p>I'm also teaching English as a second language, reading widely, and maintaining relationships with people I care about while being honest that this path may lead me away from conventional life.</p>
            
            <p>If you're interested in joining this exploration, please reach out. I'm looking for genuine dialogue. This is the beginning of a conversation, not an application process.</p>

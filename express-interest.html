            <p class="intro-text">If Kinship resonates with you and you're interested in exploring this path together, please fill out this form. These questions help us begin a meaningful conversation about whether this exploration calls to you and what you might bring to it.</p>
            
            <p>This is for those who hear "primitive" as a compliment rather than an insult—who see living close to the land, using simple tools, meeting needs directly as aspiration rather than deprivation. If that doesn't resonate, this path probably isn't for you.</p>
            
            <p>Take your time with your answers. Thoughtful responses matter more than speed. There are no "right" answers—I'm looking for genuine engagement with the ideas and honest self-assessment about what this path might require.</p>
            
            <p>This is the beginning of a dialogue, not an application process. If there seems to be alignment, we can begin a conversation about what exploring together might look like.</p>

                <p><strong>What Happens Next?</strong></p>
                <p>I'll read your submission carefully and respond within a few weeks. If there seems to be alignment, we can begin a conversation about what exploring together might look like—perhaps meeting in person, exchanging ideas, discussing timelines and possibilities.</p>
                <p>This is not an application with acceptance or rejection. It's the beginning of a dialogue between people who might walk a path together. Some conversations will lead to deeper engagement, others to mutual recognition that this isn't the right fit. Both outcomes are valuable.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to engage thoughtfully with these questions. Your willingness to consider this path, regardless of where it leads, matters.</p>
